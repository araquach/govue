            <p><strong>Go</strong> has become one of the most trending languages in the developer community because it strikes a balance between dynamic and statically compiled languages. The code is easy to read, the specification is short and it includes a built-in web server!
                It's a powerful, flexible and extremely concise language that makes a perfect backend for any app.</p>
            <p><strong>Vue</strong> (pronounced view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.</p>
